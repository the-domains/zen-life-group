Christopher Jordan has been a in the hospitality business for more than half his life and he has always believed that "life is meant to be lived sincerely and from the heart." In order to accomplish this, Chris knew that he had to embrace his passion for living life in service to others, by creating businesses that would bring a sense of peace and harmony to all those who dear to enjoy their own lives. 

Today Christopher & Partner Tracey Rowell are poised to launch two of their creations,  Glamp Island which allows those who long to commune with nature but cannot stand the inconveniences of camping, to do so from the lap of luxurious accommodations, on some of the world's most beautiful Islands and, Haarlem & Hudson, a craft cocktail bar and restaurant on 125th street in Harlem NYC.
